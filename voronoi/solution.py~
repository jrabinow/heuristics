#Our solution assumes the newest version of numpy and scipy
#You will need gcc, gfortran, liblapack-dev-base, matlibplot, and cython
#This code was inspired by http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-dev/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.Voronoi.html

#setting up the board
board = []

#We send index of 1000 x 1000 because of the problem specification
#xrange is used to give an iterator which uses far less memory
for i in xrange(100):
    for j in xrange(100):
        board.append([j,i])

#instantiation is slow with a Voronoi object...approximately 5 seconds, this is troubling
#we may want to consider using Cython


#plotting is slow
